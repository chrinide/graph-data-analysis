# graph-data-analysis
Worked with a number of real-world datasets available at http://snap.stanford.edu/ to identify the importance of certain nodes in terms of their degree, betweenness, closeness centralities and clustering co-efficient. • Studied the different random graph generator models to identify the best synthetic random graph generator that reflects real-world datasets better and experimented it with the large social networking sites such as Facebook. • Visualized the graphs using tools such as Gephi, Cystoscape and GraphViz and experimented with different layouts to identify the best visualization layout that distinguishes the critical characteristics of the network.
